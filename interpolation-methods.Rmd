# Rationale

class: left, top

# Rationale

- Traditionally, spatial interpolation has been widely used to estimate pollution levels across surface areas

--

- The advantages were to get a broad sense of pollution estimation and get outputs with less calculation effort

--

- However, the statistical overfitting from variograms had over/under-estimated the outcomes that smoothed out the variance

--

- Nevertheless, it can still be worthwhile to model the results and compare them with the individual sensor data.

# Method 1: Generalised Additive Models (GAMs)
---
class: left, top

# GAM: Concept

- GAM is a non-parametric extension of GLMs, and used when the modeller has no **a priori** hypothesis to select any parametric response functions (Borokini 2016, Wood 2017)

--

    - e.g. linear, logistic, or quadratic <- `whichever model suits`

--

$$g(E(Y))= α + s_1(x_1) + ... + s_p(x_p),$$

--

    - where Y is the dependent variable of index
    - E(Y) denotes the expected value, 
    - g( ) denotes the link function that links the expected value 
    - predictor variables x~1~, … x~p~

--

- Each predictor has a relationship with the dependent variable that can be indicated as a scatterplot

---
class: left, top

# GAM: Concept (cont.)

- **Penalised regression splines**: Once the dots are splitted to sections, the linkage between sections called *knots* are matched with polynomial functions (e.g. piecewise linear regression), then connects the untied points with smooth / link functions (e.g. loess, cyclic cubic, P-spline, tensor product) (Wood, 2017)

--

```{r piecewise, echo=FALSE, fig.show = 'hold', out.width = "60%", fig.align= "center", fig.cap = ""}
knitr::include_graphics("interpolation-methods_files/piecewise.png")
```

--

- Adding functions to knots to predict the link function is what we call an *additive* model.

- Model fitting is based on likelihood e.g. AIC, RMSE

---
class: left, top

# Advantages

- **Flexibility**: GAM is also known as a semi-parametric model as the assumptions are generous, and the relationships between response and predictors can find their best fit (Wood, 2017)

--

    - can be compared to OLS regression or GLMs that underlies strict parametric assumptions
    - useful when the relationship between the dependent and predictive variables are expected to be complex, and not easily fitted to a linear estimate

--

- **Additivity**: Categorical predictors are also able to be included in the model e.g. landcover types, gender.

--

- **Avoid overfitting**: Regularisation of predictor function helps avoid overfitting

---
class: left, top

# Disadvantages

--

-  **Weakness to overfitting**: Since the model has its elasticity of smoothness for model fitting, a modeller has to be conscious in controlling the wiggliness. 

--

    - Modellers should take into account two things when fitting a nonlinear model: close to data (avoiding underfitting), and not fitting the noise (avoid overfitting). 
    
--

    - Possible alternatives are to check whether the knots are too many or small by using `gam.check` or `qqgam` functions in R.

--

- **Slow execution speed**

# GAM: example plot


- Despite the difficulty of model interpretation and overfitting, it is preferred in spatial and temporal interpolation created with sophisticated smoothing methods.

(B) shows the observed and modelled relationship of residuals from DEM. Using the GAM approach, a series of interpolated PM<sub>10</sub> maps are shown in (C)."}

# Method 2: Kriging
---
class: left, top

# Kriging: Concept

--

- Kriging is a geostatistical interpolation method that predicts an estimate for an unmeasured location, given the characterized mean and variance structures.

--

- This method follows Tobler’s First Law of Geography: *Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things*

    - by calculating the overall mean, distance, and variance of all observations.

--

$$\widehat{X}(s_{o}) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \lambda_{i}Z(s_{i})$$

- Z(s<sub>i</sub>) = the measured value at the $i$th location
- $\lambda$<sub>i</sub> = an unknown weight for the measured value at the ith location
- s<sub>0</sub>$ = the prediction location
- *N* = the number of measured values

- The variance feature that represents spatial dependency is assessed by using a variogram

---

# Kriging: Concept(Cont.)

```{r kriging, echo=FALSE, fig.show = "asis", out.width = "100%", fig.align= "center", fig.cap= "Conceptual process of Kriging measurement"}
knitr::include_graphics("interpolation-methods_files/kriging_concept.png")
```

- A: Distance and the half-squared variances of all points. The dots are then filled into imaginary bins, and finally averaged to a single value. 

- B: A model of made from the blue dots. 

- C: Using three covariance parameters - range, partial sill, and nugget -, C creates a new covariance function. The range is the distance at which a spatial correlation exists. The partial sill and nugget parameters represent spatial and non-spatial variability, respectively.

# Kriging types

Once the variogram is confirmed, the interpolation can be modelled under different mathematical approaches.

- **Ordinary kriging** assumes a constant mean over space

- **Universal kriging** includes covariates in a regression framework to represent local variation

- Other approaches: **co-Kriging, block Kriging, simple Kriging**, and a mixture of either Kriging methods.

class: left, top

# Advantages

- Statistically proven analysis: **exploratory stat analysis -> semivariogram -> consider radius -> predict results**

- Explicit calculations for Semivariograms, and easy manipulation in model fitting: **choose semivariogram models, adjust range, nugget**

- *R specific* Small memory storage -> Appropriate for big data processes on local machine

---
class: left, top

# Disadvantages

- It does not consider various **built environments (e.g. roads, bridges, buildings, parks)** nor physical environments (e.g. mountains, weather) that cause a massive difference in our real world. 
    - Hoek (2017): > Kriging outcomes that only takes pollution fields into consideration can underestimate the spatial variation of locations that are further away from the stations.

--

- Max distance for local Kriging: if the max Dist isn't specified the local boundary will be considered as infinity `Maxdist = inf`, which slows down the modelling speed

--

- Randomness of Semivariogram model selection

--

- Smooths *out* the extremes during interpolation: even if the model is fitted, the smoothness of model may end up over/under-fitted, which in turn will have artifact results or have edge or bull's eye effects

# Problems still remain...

- This section introduces a new approach of additional road effect that superimposes spatial interpolation outcomes. 

--

- Spatial interpolation itself contains variances and biases, particularly when temporal aggregation interval is short and monitoring stations are distant to each other 

    - e.g. Land Use Regression

--

- Even in the same study area, the signifance of predictor variables would differ to the previous year or it might not be selected 

    - e.g. Fluid dynamic models

# Solution: Applying Additional Road Effects on Spatial Interpolation Outputs

- Assuming that the pollution impacts are higher near roads, how can we apply additional road effects on top of spatial interpolations?

--

- With a spatially coarse, but temporarilly abundant data, can we do something *cool*?

--

- To overcome these limitations, an alternative appraoch is to measure **12 hour average of background stations and roadside stations**, **compare the ratio**, then **apply the ratio to road layouts**.
