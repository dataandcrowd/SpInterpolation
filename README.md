This is a repository for various spatial interpolation methods  in atmospheric pollution.<br>
I strive to model pollutions with 76 monitoring stations of which 25 are background stations in Seoul, 32 are background stations that are within the 10km distance from the adminstrative boundary of Seoul, and 15 are roadside stations in Seoul, and 4 are roadside stations within the 10km distance from the adminstrative boundary of Seoul.
