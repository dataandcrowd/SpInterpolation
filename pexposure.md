outcome?

## Abstract

<br><br><br>

## Rationale

![](pexposure/journal.PNG)<!-- -->

  - Ignoring the spatiotemporal variability of environmental risk
    factors and human mobility may lead to misleading results in
    exposure assessment (See [Yoo Min Park and Mei-Po
    Kwan](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353829216304415))
    \>
  - **Where people live** is often not the only important factor in
    determining their exposure to environmental factors
  - Rather, **where people visit** and **how much time they spend at** a
    particualr location are more relevant to assessing the effects of
    environmental factors on peopleâ€™s health behaviours or outcomes

## Overview of Trajectories(Cont.)

  - 16142 records of 5 individual backpack sensors measured by minutes

<br><br><br>

## Clusters of footprints

  - Points are the footprints for each researcher
  - The ellipsoid represents the 95% confidence of the distribution of
    points on the map
  - The footprint of researchers are centered in Gwanak district,
    particularly situated in the University
Campus.

## (Near) Future works

  - Use *walking* and *strolling* info to compare modelled outcome
  - Consider time scale from minutes to 12 hour aggregation
